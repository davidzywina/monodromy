# Computing monodromy of abelian varieties

The file "monodromy.m" implements several of the algorithmic results from the paper "Computing monodromy of abelian varieties"  (http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zywina/papers/Monodromy/Monodromy.pdf) in Magma (http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/).

Some basic examples of these functions is given in "examples.m".
